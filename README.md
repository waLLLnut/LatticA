# LatticA – Deterministic Confidential Computing for Solana
_Confidential program: privacy rail for institutions_

- LatticA builds **Next**, the Solana‑native confidential computing layer that makes encrypted data computable and verifiable anywhere — from mobile to server — through our portable **FHE16** stack (Fully Homomorphic Encryption).
- Institutions can lend, swap, or manage risk without revealing private inputs until they choose to, establishing the foundation for deterministic, verifiable privacy on‑chain.

## Beyond privacy, we secure provenance
By combining **FHE16** with **zkTLS** (planned), LatticA ensures every encrypted input is cryptographically tied to its true source without leaking financial data — forming the trust execution for compliant, data‑driven DeFi.

**Good‑bye front‑running. Hello institutions.**
